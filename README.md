## HTML Deliverables
  - HTML Pages: Three different pages. One for each view. index.html(login), pokelist.html, pokeDetail.html
  - Proper HTML element usage: I used all the right tags as I already am familiar with html
  - Links: there are links between views
  - Text: there is some example/placeholder text for things
  - Placeholder for 3rd party service calls - The list page will be generated from a 3rd party service call as well as the poke detail page
  - Images: Image is displayed on pokeDetail page
  - Login placeholder, including user name display: The login placeholder is on the index.html page
  - Database data placeholder showing content stored in the database: Comments are on the pokedetail which will be stored in the database
  - WebSocket data placeholder showing where realtime communication will go: There is a comment section where users can post and see other comments

## CSS Deliverables
- Header, footer and main content body: I used a mix of bootstrap and custom css to style these `main.css`. The other pages have their own css files `pokelist.css` and `pokeDetail.css`
- Navigation elements: used mostly bootstrap for this, but changed some color using custom css
- Responsive to window resizing: Bootstrap and flex made this fairly easy, the list page was a little more flex heavy.
- Application elements: Used a lot of bootstrap and flex here as well to align things
- Application text content: I used custom css to change so colors and font sizes
- Application images: I always struggle sizing images, but was able to get a default image for each card and resized it using custom css.
